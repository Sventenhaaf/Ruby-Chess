Chess Game written in Ruby. You need to have a general understanding of ruby and pry or irb.

To play the game, do the following:

* Download the repo
* cd to the (chess-master) directory
* gem install colorize
* pry
* in pry, do:
  * load 'game.rb'
  * Game.new.run

And off you go. Castling and other advanced moves are currently not possible, I might add them to the game later on.

Enjoy!
